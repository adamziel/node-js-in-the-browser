-   ✅ Support shell scripts with bash-like syntax.
    -   ✅ Integrate shell parser, e.g. https://github.com/raphamorim/flash.
    -   ✅ Add a system() function that can be used to execute shell commands.
    -   ✅ Support shebang in scripts in general.
-   ✅ Support interpreters
    -   ✅ /bin/js
    -   ✅ /bin/sh
    -   ✅ /bin/php
-   ✅ Support more programs
    -   ✅ /bin/node
    -   ✅ /bin/npm
-   Support ESM
    -   await import("globby")
    -   via either:
        -   a service worker that resolves dynamic imports
        -   a transpiler that converts imports to require() calls,
            potentially supporting require.async() or so
-   Support multiple filesystems
    -   Decentralized SharedArrayBuffer filesystem (handled by each child process)
    -   ✅ Decentralized OPFS (handled by each child process)
-   Streams
    -   ✅ Actual fd 0 1 2 for stdio streams
    -   ✅ Blocking read() for stdin
    -   TTY
-   Shell program
    -   Interactive mode that gets stdio from xterm.js and
        outputs control sequences to xterm.js. For example, when the user types a character,
        the shell process needs to see it immediately on stdin and decide what to do with it.
        Could be running a program, could be extending an internal buffer, could be moving
        the cursor to the beginning of the line or next word, etc.
-   Debug mode
    -   All the output of all processes in the browser's devtools
    -   All the pipes status is known (Process 1->2 [blocked], etc)
