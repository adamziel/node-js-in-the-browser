# Kernel Runtime Sandbox

A browser-based kernel sandbox that mirrors a small POSIX-like environment using Web Workers. It powers the interactive BusyBox style utilities, process orchestration, and shell that ship with the Playground runtime.

Example usage:

```js
import { installBusybox } from '../runtime/busybox/index.ts'
import { installPhpInterpreter } from './programs/php-interpreter.ts'
import { Kernel } from '../runtime/index.ts'

const kernel = new Kernel()
installBusybox(kernel)

// Simple shell scripts are parsed, each command is implemented as a separate
// TypeScript module and executed in a separate process with a pipe between
// their stdio.
kernel.writeFileSync(
	`/my-script.sh`,
	`
   echo "Hello, world from a script!" | cat
   touch /new-file.txt
   `,
	{ mode: 0o755 }
)
await runProgram(['sh', '/my-script.sh'])

// All processes share the same filesystem so we'll see the `new-file.txt`
// in the output.
console.log(kernel.readdirSync('/', 'utf8'))

// Custom interperters are supported
installPhpInterpreter(kernel)
kernel.writeFileSync(`/my-script.php`, `<?php echo "Hello from PHP!"; ?>`, {
	mode: 0o755,
})
await runProgram(['php', '/my-script.php'])

// Helper function to run a program with a single line of code
function runProgram(argv: string[]) {
	const worker = kernel.spawn({
		argv,
		env: {},
		cwd: '/',
		name: 'shell',
		debug: true,
	})
	if (typeof worker === 'number') {
		throw new Error('Failed to spawn program')
	}

	return new Promise((resolve) => {
		worker.onExit((code) => {
			resolve(code)
		})
	})
}
```

## High-Level Architecture

- **App (`app/`)** – Vite-powered entrypoint that boots a worker-based kernel, installs bundled BusyBox programs, and drives demos or playground code.
- **Runtime (`runtime/`)** – The core platform code:
  - `core/` implements the kernel, in-memory filesystem, and process registry.
  - `process/` manages worker lifecycles, stdio plumbing over `MessagePort`s, synchronous spawn bridges, and filesystem RPC.
  - `shell/` provides a parser (via Flash) plus an execution engine that can pipeline commands, forward stdio, and respect redirects.
  - `busybox/` contains individual command programs, each compiled to strings and injected into the virtual filesystem.
- **Shared Utilities** – Helpers for path normalization, serialized message formats, and pump workers that move data between the host and child processes.

## How It Works

1. The kernel exposes a POSIX-flavored API (`processController`) to child workers: spawn, exit, env, stdio, and filesystem methods.
2. BusyBox programs are emitted as plain JavaScript sources and written into `/bin`. When invoked, they run inside isolated workers, reporting results through message channels.
3. The shell parses user input into a Flash AST, resolves each node into command executions, and orchestrates pipes or redirects by wiring `MessagePortReadableStream`/`MessagePortWritableStream` instances.
4. All filesystem calls resolve into the in-memory FS, with sync and async bridges handled by a shared pump worker so that synchronous APIs stay responsive.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies from the project root:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Launch the Vite dev server for the kernel sandbox:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server opens `app/index.html`, which spins up the kernel worker and runs the sample scripts.

## Project Structure

```
app/                     # Custom app built on top of the kernel
runtime/
  core/                  # Kernel implementation
  process/               # Process workers, spawn options, IPC plumbing
  busybox/               # Command sources (cat, ls, sh, etc.)
  shell/                 # Flash parser bindings and execution engine
  ipc/                   # Shared sync pump worker + message streams
README.md
vite.config.ts           # Vite setup scoped to this package
```

## Development Notes

- BusyBox programs are authored as TypeScript modules that export source-string factories. Keep runtime work minimal and use `runtime/busybox/lib/utils.ts` helpers for argument parsing, stdout/stderr, and exits.
- Pipelines are wired via message ports; if you add new programs with custom stdio requirements, reuse the helpers in `runtime/shell/run.ts`.
- The kernel’s filesystem is purely in-memory. Persisting state or adding host-backed storage requires extending `runtime/core/kernel.ts` together with the filesystem serialization utilities.
- For shell enhancements, update the Flash parser bindings in `runtime/shell/sh.ts` and the execution logic in `runtime/shell/run.ts`.

## Further Reading

See `app/main-app.ts` for an end-to-end example that boots the kernel, installs BusyBox, and runs demo commands.
